# CS 360 Project 1 Part I: The Metacircular Evaluator

Collaborators: Manish, Ethan, Oscar

Was unable to complete question 4.
Problem 1 was very straight forward exept for the lambda needed for the error to comeplete the primitives. Problem 2 took a lot of trial and error. Once I had gotten the idea of using the env and values as well as the evaluator I was able to work effeciently on the function definition itself. This question had the most collaboration from the group as many of us had different ideas to solve it. After TA help we were finally able to get a function that passed all tests and overcome the unidentified variable error. Problem 3 took a lot of time mostly becuase I did not understand the instructions at all. I tried a lot of things that, once looking back, made no sense at all. Finally once understood what was being asked, we were able to get the let function done. Problem 4, I just did not get personally.
